# Building an EDA model for Supply Chain Optimization
This project involves the development of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) model for Flipkart's supply chain data. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, aggregation, correlation analysis, and visualization, ultimately supporting strategic decision-making. The project leverages various data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
The eda folder contains:

-Data Exploration: Google Colab notebooks and scripts exploring the dataset.

-Data Cleaning: Code and documentation for handling missing values and outliers.

-Visualizations: Plots and charts illustrating key trends and patterns in the data.
## Key Features:
-Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.

-Data Aggregation: Summarizing data to provide meaningful insights.

-Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between different variables.

-Data Visualization: Creating various plots (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc.) to visualize data trends and patterns.

## Statistical Analysis
Explore the statistical_analysis folder for:

-Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics and key metrics.
-Correlation Analysis: Code and results examining relationships between variables.
-Distribution Analysis: Scripts for analyzing the distribution of key variables
## Hypothesis Testing 
In the hypothesis_testing folder, find:

Formulation: Documentation on the formulation of hypotheses.

Testing Procedures: Code and results for hypothesis tests conducted.

Conclusion: Summary and interpretation of hypothesis testing outcomes.
## Linear Regression
Navigate to the linear_regression folder for:

Model Development: Jupyter notebooks or scripts building linear regression models.

Evaluation Metrics: Code and documentation for assessing model performance.

Predictions: Results and insights from the linear regression analysis.
