# Building-an-EDA-model-for-Supply-Chain-Optimization

This project involves the development of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) model for Flipkart's supply chain data. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, aggregation, correlation analysis, and visualization, ultimately supporting strategic decision-making. The project leverages various data analysis and visualization techniques.
